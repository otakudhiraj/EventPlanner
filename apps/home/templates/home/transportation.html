    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
        Nepal, with its diverse geography, poses both opportunities and challenges when it comes to event transportation.
        Whether you're planning a wedding in the hills of Nagarkot or a corporate retreat in Pokhara, understanding the
        logistics of transportation is crucial to ensuring a smooth event experience.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-secondary mb-3">1. Transportation Needs by Venue Location</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Event venues across Nepal vary from easily accessible urban banquet halls to remote resorts in the mountains.
            Transportation planning must account for guest mobility, weather conditions, and road access.

            <li><strong>Kathmandu Valley:</strong> Most venues here are accessible by car or van.</li>
            <li><strong>Hilly Regions:</strong> Resorts may need 4WD vehicles or shuttles for guests.</li>
            <li><strong>Terai Belt:</strong> Easier transport with highway access, ideal for large buses.</li>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Catering, decoration, and technical equipment vendors often require early access and dedicated logistics to

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            For destinations like Nagarkot, Dhulikhel, or Pokhara, it's recommended to provide shuttle buses or carpool
            options to guests. This ensures timely arrival and improves the overall experience.
